          It's simple: Time is money, and this shows your money as time. There
          are two different kinds of time: Earned and Survival.

        <h1 class="earned-vs-survival">Earned vs Survival</h1>
        <span class="earned-vs-survival-content">
          Earned time is based on your hourly (and your minute-ly) rate. So if
          you earn $10 per hour and buy something worth $40, you just spent 4
          earned hours. Earned time is the default view for transactions and
          your current spending balance. <br /><br />
          Survival time is based on your expenses and pay frequency. It tells
          you how many days, hours and minutes worth of bills you could pay with
          your savings. Survival time can be turned on for the Accounts page in
          preferences.
